# Welcome to TAG
Welcome to TAG, a Totally Average Game. I made this game as a summer project and finished it at the begining of 2023.

This is a numeric puzzle game with very simple rules:

- You are given a list of numbers. Choosing any two of them will transform both into their average, rounded up (e.g. 3 and 5 becomes 4, 1 and 6 becomes 4). This counts as a move.
- Your goal is to turn all the numbers in your list to the same number. This number can be as high or as low as you want, but you have to do it in the least number of moves possible.
- For example, say you were given the numbers [1, 2, 6, 8]. Your moves (in a 4-move solution) can be:
  - (1, 8) -> [5, 2, 6, 5]
  - (5, 2) -> [4, 4, 6, 5]
  - (4, 6) -> [5, 4, 5, 5]
  - (5, 4) -> [5, 5, 5, 5].

# Gameplay
The game has two modes: Story and Survival. Survival Mode will unlock after Story Mode is finished.

- Story Mode allows you to beat the levels in as many moves as you want, but you gain Dots depending on the number of moves you took.
- Survival Mode gives you a limited number of lives and the maximum number of moves to beat each level. Finishing the level with spare moves increase your lives.
